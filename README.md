# MS1 - The Love Letter

The love letter is a prints company selling both pre-made and custom wall prints. The goal of this website is to display the product for sale in a clear and easy to navigate manner to ensure customers quickly find what they are looking for, as well as establish the brand's image with bright and fun graphics and colours.  
 
 
## UX

The Love letter is for anyone looking for prints with fun, odd or ispirational (maybe all three) quotes. The layout needed to be simple and clear, given the quirky branding, to lead customers easily to the prints for sale and custom print service provided with ease. 

### User stories 

When conducting research into potential customers, the points that came up most frequently were:
- As a user, I want to the products to be easy to find, so I can select one quickly. **Addressed in print section** 
- As a user, I want the site to be usable via moblie phone so I can conveniently access it anywhere. **Addressed through responsive mobile first design** 
- As a user, I want to know about the breif history of the business to determine trustworthiness. **Addressed in about section** 
- As a user, I want to know how the cost of products upfront do decided whether to buy. **Addressed in print section** 
- As a user, I need the company to have social media to keep up with an new products or services. **Addressed in footer** 

### Strategy
To sell prints and a custom prints service using a user friendly one page design, with a clear layout that also stays true the the company branding. 

### Scope 
Providing customers with a a breif company background, then all products and services set out and well labeled so they can browse and find what they are looking for.

### Structure 
Fixed top navigation bar to get to desired sections of the site easily. Information given is short and easy to read. The function of each section of the site is labelled and  apparent to customer. 

### Skeleton
Wireframes created using figma:
- **Here**(https://getbootstrap.com/)
 

### Surface 
While the fruity background caught your eye, the print section had a plain background to ensure they stood out and were easy to read so branding did not overtake usability. 
As site branding is bright and busy, The text had to be simple and clean: 

**Roboto**- For general information throughout

**Oswald**- For the logo 

**Bowlby One SC**- For the callout


## Features

A fixed top navbar ensures customers can naviage to all sections regardless of which one they are currently in. The callout is linked to the print section to go straight to the products advertised. A one page site with various sections reduces loading times and allows for a speedier naviagation, which in turn gives the customer a better site experience. 
 
### Existing Features

- Newsletter sign up - Users can keep up to date on any changes to service, new print additions and discount codes 
- Login - To allow returning customers to purchase through their own account with saved information to streamline the process and cut down on time 

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** - To write up base website
- **CSS** - To style website to make it visually appealing
- **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)** - For responsive design  
- **[Figma](https://www.figma.com/files/recent)** - To create wireframe

## Testing

All links within the site function correctly and take you to the appropiate section. The submit button takes you to the top of the page as there is no 
All links will function, but the social media links will open the main page of that particular platform. The "Send us your details" button will return to the home section. Custom CCS code is written for every button comfort design.

This site was tested across multiple screen sizes on Chrome, Safari and Internet Explore To ensure compatibility and responsiveness it was also tested on an android based mobile device (OnePlus5). When the webpage is visited on larger screens a blue box is shown on the upper right side of the screen. This will disappear on smaller screens the box is used for direct to call actions and social media. A navigation bar is shown all the time and will transform to an option bar on smaller phone screens.

The text and card-decks will properly align on every screen size. The card-decks have some extra CSS code to improve alignment of the content within the cards. The footer will place the text beneath each other to make it better readable for smaller screens.




In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
