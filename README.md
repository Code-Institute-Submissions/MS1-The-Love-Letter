## UX

The Love letter is for anyone looking for prints with fun, odd or ispirational (maybe all three) quotes. The layout needed to be simple and clear, given the quirky branding, to lead customers easily to the prints for sale and custom print service provided with ease. 

### User stories 

When conducting research into potential customers, the points that came up most frequently were:
- As a user, I want to the products to be easy to find, so I can select one quickly. **Addressed in print section** 
- As a user, I want the site to be usable via moblie phone so I can conveniently access it anywhere. **Addressed through responsive mobile first design** 
- As a user, I want to know about the breif history of the business to determine trustworthiness. **Addressed in about section** 
- As a user, I want to know how the cost of products upfront do decided whether to buy. **Addressed in print section** 
- As a user, I need the company to have social media to keep up with an new products or services. **Addressed in footer** 

### Strategy
To sell prints and custom prints service using a user friendly 'one page' design, with a clear layout that also stays true to the company branding. 

### Scope 
Providing customers with a breif company background, then all products and services set out and well labeled so they can browse and find what they are looking for.

### Structure 
Fixed top navigation bar to get to desired sections of the site easily. Information given is short and easy to read. The function of each section of the site is labelled and  apparent to customer. 

### Skeleton
Wireframes created using figma:

### Surface 
As the fruity background is eyecatching, the print section had a plain background to ensure they stood out and were easy to read so branding did not overtake usability. 
As site branding is bright and busy, The text had to be simple and clean: 

**Roboto**- For general information throughout

**Oswald**- For the logo 

**Bowlby One SC**- For the callout



## Features

A fixed top navbar ensures customers can naviage to all sections regardless of which one they are currently in. The callout is linked to the print section to go straight to the products advertised. A one page site with various sections reduces loading times and allows for a speedier naviagation, which in turn gives the customer a better site experience. 
 
 
### Features Left to Implement

- Newsletter sign up - Users can keep up to date on any changes to service, new print additions and discount codes 
- Login - To allow returning customers to purchase through their own account with saved information to streamline the process and cut down on time 



## Technologies Used

- **HTML** - To write up base website
- **CSS** - To style website to make it visually appealing

- **[Figma](https://www.figma.com/files/recent)** - To create wireframe



## Testing

All links within the site function correctly and take you to the appropiate section. The submit button takes you to the top of the page as there is no 'completed' event. Social media links open to the home page of each social site. 

The site was tested across multiple screens sizes both personally and via inspect. Personally, it was opened on an iPhoneX, iPad mini, iPad Pro, iMac, Macbook Pro, as well as a 15.3inch and 17.3" Windows laptops. All screen sizes worked as desired.

In Chrome, Internet Explorer and Safari via inspect, the site displayed and fucnctioned as intended at all screen sizes. In all cases, the callout images changes betwwen phone, tablet and laptop/desktop were displayed correctly. The logo text size is also subject to change between screen sizes and does so at the stated points. The navagtion bar collapses at moblie veiw to accomodate the size change. 

The in moblie view footer will text appear one beneath the other to fit the available space while remaining readable.



## Bugs

**Cards**

A faint white border appears sporadically around the cards both in the physical tests and via inspection, although all borders have been removed this problem persists. 

**Functionality test sites**

**Site loading**

Although optimised as far as possible, the callout image still remains a large file and slows the loading of the site. 

**Submit**

THe submit button is linked to 'home', which when clicked is to take you to the top of the page. However it occationally, across all screen sizes fails to do so until the page is refreshed. Another issue is it sometimes stops at the print section instead of the top, also rectified when the page is refreshed.
